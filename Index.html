 <p>Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. 
    In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.
    The small number of basic origami folds can be combined in a variety of ways to make intricate designs.

<h3>How to Make A Frog Using Origami</h3>

<ol>
<li>Fold the paper in half sideways to make a rectangle.</li>
<li>Fold the corners down and unfold them right away, repeating this for both top corners of your rectangle.</li>
<li>Flip the paper over and fold the top of the paper down at the spot where the diagonal creases meet. Unfold right away.</li>
<li>Flip over once again, and fold the two edges toward you so they meet each other.The top of your rectangle will fold down to form a triangle.</li>
<li>Fold the bottom of the paper up so that its edge meets the bottom of your triangle.Fold the two corners of the triangle up to form the "front legs" of the frog.</li>
<li>Fold the sides inward to meet at the center</li>
<li>Fold the bottom of the paper upward so its edge touches the bottom of the "legs," and unfold right away.</li>
<li>Insert your fingers into the inside of the flaps, and pull the bottom corners outward to the sides, so that the bottom edge comes up to touch the bottom of the "legs."</li>
<li>Fold the corners down so they meet at the bottom of the figure.</li>
<li>Fold the bottom corners outward to form the "back legs" of the frog.</li>
<li>Create a zigzag fold at the bottom of the figure, folding the bottom half up and then the bottom quarter back down</li>
